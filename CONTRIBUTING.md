# Contributing to nlogos

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

There are three ways that you can contribute that would be super helpful right now:

1. [Add logos for existing node/npm modules]().
2. [Request that someone creates a logo for one of your open source node/npm modules]().
3. [Mmake the code better or docs clearer]().

## Add logos for existing node/npm modules

Right now there are ton of modules which have logos but are not in this repo. A good way to get the most bang for the buck is to go through [npm's most depended-upon packages](https://www.npmjs.com/browse/depended) and find packages that have a logo but have not been added to [NLogo's `logos.json` file](https://github.com/davej/NLogo/blob/master/logos.json).

## Request that someone creates a logo for one of your open source node/npm modules

If you have an open-source npm module and you would like to request a logo design then comment on issue #1 and we'll try to hook people up.

This is pro-bono and supply of people designing logos might not meet demand from open-source devs but please be kind, patient and courteous.
